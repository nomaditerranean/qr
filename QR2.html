<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

<p>I copied this template from w3schools <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp" >here</a>. Information about how to make links is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_basic_link" >here</a></p>

<p>I'm editing this as a text file. First I'll save it with the html extension. Then I'll use the instructions on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" >this page</a> to try and host this as a Web page on GitHub (selected Project File then Start From Scratch). Then I'll take the address and use bit.ly to get a short URL. Then all I need to do is make a QR code from the short URL.</p>
